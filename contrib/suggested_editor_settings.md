# Suggested settings for Godot's editor

## "Text Editor" section

* Files
  * _Open Dominant Script On Scene Change_ **Off**, so opening a scene doesn't open its linked script everytime.

* Cursor
  * _Scroll Past End Of File_ **On**, so it's more comfortable to type new lines at the end of the file.
